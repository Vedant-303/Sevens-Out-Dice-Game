## 📜 Game Rules

### 🎮 Gameplay:

- Players take turns rolling **two dice**.
- The **sum** of the dice is added to the player’s score — **unless it's 7**.
- If the **sum is 7**, the player's turn ends:
  - In **easy mode**, the score remains the same.
  - In **hard mode**, the player’s score resets to **0**.
- If a player rolls a **double** (both dice show the same number), their total score for that turn **doubles**.
- The first player to reach the **target score** wins!

### 🧠 Difficulty Levels:

- **Easy Mode**:
  - Score is safe even after rolling 7.
- **Hard Mode**:
  - Rolling a 7 resets your score to 0.
